# Getting Started - MeOS Entry Build Application

> ðŸ“š **Quick Navigation**: See [DOCS_INDEX.md](DOCS_INDEX.md) for complete documentation index

## What You Have Right Now

You have a working web application that will help manage event day registration for MeOS orienteering events. The application is currently running on your computer and ready to be customized.

## Step 1: View Your Application (Do This Now!)

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

2. **Go to this address**: `http://localhost:5173/`
   - Type this exactly in your browser's address bar
   - Press Enter

3. **You should see**: A dashboard with "MeOS Entry Management" at the top

4. **What you'll notice**:
   - Three big buttons: "New Registration", "Modify Entry", "Manage Cards"
   - A red warning saying "Disconnected from MeOS" (this is normal - we don't have MeOS running yet)
   - Statistics showing 0 entries, 50 available cards, etc.

## Step 2: Understanding What the Application Does

### The Big Picture
This application will help you on event day by:
- Registering new participants who show up without pre-registering
- Changing information for people who did pre-register (like their course or SI card number)
- Managing rental SI cards (who has them, when they're returned, etc.)

### The Three Main Features
1. **New Registration** - For walk-in participants
2. **Modify Entry** - For changing existing registrations
3. **Manage Cards** - For rental SI card tracking

## Step 3: What Happens Next

We'll build these features one at a time, starting with the most important one: **New Registration**.

### Your Role
- **Testing**: Click buttons and tell me if anything looks wrong
- **Requirements**: Tell me exactly how you want things to work
- **Feedback**: Let me know if something is confusing or doesn't match your workflow

### My Role
- **Building**: I'll create the features you need
- **Explaining**: I'll walk you through each step
- **Testing**: I'll make sure everything works properly

## Step 4: Next Development Steps (We'll Do These Together)

### Phase 1: Basic Registration Form (This Week)
1. **Create the registration form** - I'll build this
2. **Test it with fake data** - You'll help me test
3. **Connect to MeOS** - We'll test with your MeOS system

### Phase 2: Make It Work With Real Data (Next Week)  
1. **Test with your MeOS setup** - Using your actual MeOS installation
2. **Fix any problems** - Adjust based on your specific needs
3. **Add validation** - Make sure bad data can't be entered

### Phase 3: Add More Features (Later)
1. **Entry modifications** - Change courses, cards, etc.
2. **Card management** - Track rental cards
3. **Reports** - Generate summaries of registrations

## How to Work with the Application

### While Development Server is Running
- **Making Changes**: I can modify the code and you'll see changes instantly in your browser
- **Testing Features**: Click buttons, fill out forms, and tell me what happens
- **Stopping the Server**: Press `q` in the PowerShell window to stop

### Important Files (Don't Worry About These)
- The code lives in folders with names like `src/components` and `src/services`
- I'll handle all the technical details
- You just need to test and provide feedback

## What You Need to Prepare

To make this application work with your MeOS setup, I'll need some information from you:

### About Your MeOS Installation
1. **Where is MeOS installed?** (Usually something like `C:\Program Files\MeOS`)
2. **Do you have MeOS running right now?** (We can test this later)
3. **What port does MeOS use for its web service?** (We can figure this out together)

### About Your Event Process
1. **What information do you collect for same-day registration?**
   - Name (obviously)
   - Club
   - Course/class
   - SI card number
   - Birth year?
   - Phone number?
   - Anything else?

2. **How do you handle rental cards?**
   - Do you charge a deposit?
   - How much?
   - Do you track card condition?

3. **What reports do you need?**
   - List of all entries?
   - Financial summary?
   - Card rental status?

## Ready for the Next Step?

Once you've looked at the application in your browser (Step 1), let me know:

1. **Can you see the dashboard?** (Yes/No)
2. **Do the buttons respond when you click them?** (They should show messages in the browser console)
3. **Does anything look broken or confusing?**
4. **Are you ready to start building the registration form?**

## How to Get Help

If anything goes wrong or you have questions:

1. **Take a screenshot** - Show me what you're seeing
2. **Describe what happened** - What did you click? What did you expect?
3. **Check the browser console** - Press F12 in your browser and look for any red error messages

## What's Next

Once you've tested the basic dashboard, we'll start building the **New Registration** form. This will be the first real feature that connects to MeOS and creates actual event entries.

Remember: You don't need to understand the code - just tell me what you want the application to do, and I'll make it happen!
