# Testing Rollback Functionality

## What's Been Added

### ✅ **Auto-save System**
- **Every action auto-saves** - Check-ins, edits, imports, deletions all trigger auto-save
- **Smart file management** - Keeps latest 5 auto-saves, cleans up old ones
- **Import protection** - Prevents spam during bulk imports
- **Dual storage** - Files when available, localStorage as fallback

### ✅ **Rollback UI**
- **Rollback dropdown** - Shows available backup points with timestamps
- **Confirmation modal** - Detailed info before rollback with safety warnings
- **Real-time updates** - Rollback count updates as backups are created
- **Visual indicators** - Shows backup timestamp, entry count, and filename

### ✅ **Safety Features**
- **Pre-rollback backup** - Current state is saved before rollback
- **Multiple restore points** - Main backup + 3 auto-save rotations
- **Detailed logging** - Console logs track all backup operations

## How It Works

### Auto-save Triggers:
```
✅ Check someone in → Auto-save
✅ Edit an entry → Auto-save  
✅ Delete an entry → Auto-save
✅ Import entries → Auto-save (after import completes)
✅ Add new entry → Auto-save
```

### Rollback Points Available:
1. **Previous State** - Before last major save
2. **Auto-save 1** - Most recent auto-save
3. **Auto-save 2** - Second most recent  
4. **Auto-save 3** - Third most recent

### File Locations:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Working directory (if set) with cleanup
- **Fallback**: localStorage rotation system
- **Filenames**: `meos_entries_autosave_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.json`

## Testing Steps

1. **Import your JSON backup** - This creates initial backup points
2. **Make some changes** - Check in a few runners, edit entries
3. **Check rollback dropdown** - Should show multiple backup points
4. **Try a rollback** - Select a backup point and confirm rollback
5. **Verify data restored** - Check that entries match the backup point
6. **Check rollback count** - Should update to show new backup points

## Benefits

### ✅ **Never Lose Data**
- Every action is immediately backed up
- Multiple restore points available
- Works even if browser crashes/refreshes

### ✅ **Easy Recovery**  
- One-click rollback to any backup point
- Clear timestamps and entry counts
- Safe confirmation before rollback

### ✅ **Event Day Ready**
- Reliable data persistence during busy event day
- Quick recovery from accidental deletions
- Multiple backup strategies (file + localStorage)

The system is now much more robust and should prevent any data loss scenarios!
